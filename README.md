SEO Friendly Forum Title
------------------------

SEO Friendly Forum Title is a modification for phpBB 3.0.x that optimizes generated titles (from `<title>` tag) by placing the most important phrases at the beginning (e.g. topic title or forum name). This makes them more friendly for search engines and users who have opened multiple tabs in their browsers. It also adds pagination numbers to prevent duplicated titles.


Installation
------------

Modification is compatible with [AutoMOD](https://www.phpbb.com/mods/automod/). If you prefer manual installation, open `install.xml` in the browser and follow the instructions.
